Code and scripts from https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo2, as well as some of my own.

Forgot to add weight link. The link is specified in the 'Outline of steps' here:

https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo2/blob/master/Yolo%20Step-by-Step.ipynb

Link to weights:
https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolo.weights

This weight file must be in the same folder as yolo.py.
